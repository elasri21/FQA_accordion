# Frontend Mentor - FAQ accordion

![Design preview for the FAQ accordion coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this FAQ accordion and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

It is possible to use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

The users should be able to:

- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
- Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## Where to find everything

The task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design.

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.

All the required assets for this project are in the `/assets` folder. The images are already exported for the correct screen size and optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Building your project

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with.

## Deploying your project

As mentioned above, there are many ways to host your project for free. Our recommend hosts are:

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [My GitHub](https://github.com/elasri21)

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
